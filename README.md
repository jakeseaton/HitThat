Pods

**Notes**
Pods were installed manually, so you won't have to run pod install or worry about a workspace file. Sue me.

To Use
---
1) Open the HitThat.xcodeproj file.
2) Set the build destination to the simulator's iphone 5s or your ios device.
3) Press play

**Notes**
-You'll need to build it to an ios device to experience all of the functionality. For that you'll need an apple developer account.
-It has only been tested on a 5s, and the simulator.
